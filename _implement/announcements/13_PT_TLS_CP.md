**US Federal Public Trust TLS Certificate Policy**

The current version (v1.0) of the [US Federal Public Trust TLS Certificate Policy](https://devicepki.idmanagement.gov/assets/docs/us-federal-public-trust-tls-cp.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} has been archived.  This version of the policy was completed in 2019 in order to prepare for a publicly trusted government operated PKI aimed at facilitating TLS certificate issuance for .mil and .gov websites.

**Document Updates**

As the initial operational capability of the US Federal Public Trust PKI is nearing, the US Federal Public Trust TLS Certificate Policy is currently undergoing revisions in order to accommodate the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/B) Forum's most recent updates to their [baseline requirements](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} for public trust TLS. 

Moving forward the updated certificate policy will be appoved by the FPKIPA and published to [devicepki.idmanagement.gov](https://devicepki.idmanagement.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}, and will be announced here in the [FPKI Playbook Annoucements]({{site.baseurl}}/fpki/announcements/), stay tuned.
