Place holder text Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.


## Vendors

Federal agencies require systems and services to be functional, secure, and compatible with other products. The General Services Administration supports these requirements through testing and identifying products and services.
- The GSA Federal Acqusition Service  issues long-term governmentwide contracts that provide federal, state, and local government buyers access to commercial products, services and solutions at pre negotiated pricing.
- The GSA Office of Government Policy provides testing and certification services for specific product categories.


## Acquisition Professionals

The FICAM testing program – also known as the [Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program]({{site.baseurl}}/fips201/) – tests commercial products used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKI). These products are tested and approved to ensure you're buying products that provide value and work well together.

## Program Managers

The Federal ICAM (FICAM) program helps federal agencies plan and manage enterprise identity, credentialing, and access management (ICAM) through collaboration opportunities and guidance on IT policy, standards, implementation, and architecture. Most of the guidance and best practices found on this website are developed through interagency working groups.
