## Identity, Credential, and Access Management Subcommittee

The [Identity, Credential, and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC)](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=234815732){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is the principal interagency forum for identity management, secure access, authentication, authorization, credentials, privileges, and access lifecycle management. It’s a sub-committee of the [Federal CIO Council’s Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council](https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/ciso-council/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

The ICAMSC is co-chaired by the [GSA Office of Government-wide Policy](https://gsa.gov/portal/category/21399){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and another volunteer agency (currently the Department of Justice). The ICAMSC aligns the identity management activities of the federal government and supports collaborative government-wide efforts to:
- Increase agency flexibility in addressing ICAM challenges;
- Coordinate interagency efforts to meet agency mission needs;
- Identify gaps in policies, procedures, standards, guidance, and services; and
- Align ICAM policies and compliance with other cybersecurity initiatives.

### Activities

- **Develop Policy Recommendations:** Recommends new ICAM policies and updates existing ones.
- **Provide Flexible Tools for ICAM Programs:** Develops specific tools to assist agencies' abilities to meet ICAM policy objectives and overcome ICAM implementation challenges.
- **Facilitate Communications and Information Sharing:** Acts as a vehicle for cross-government collaboration by sharing information, lessons learned, and best practices related to ICAM.

### Membership and Meetings

## Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority

The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) serves the interest of federal organizations as relying parties and promotes interoperability between federal and non-federal entities by:
- Setting policy governing the Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) Trust Infrastructure;
- Approving applicants for cross certification with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)
- Providing oversight to the Certified PKI Shared Service Provider (SSP) Program.

FPKIPA is co-chaired by the GSA Office of Government-wide Policy. The GSA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible for security authorizations and continuous monitoring for commercially-operated PKI shared service providers.

### Activities
- **Approve Policies and Practices** – Approve Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) and Federal Common Policy Certification Authority Certificate Policies (CPs), including revisions; approve FPKI Trust Infrastructure Certification Practice Statements.
- **Approve Entity Cross-Certification** – Establish and administer criteria and methodology for cross-certification with the FBCA; approve cross-certifications and execute Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs); maintain the FPKI Certification Applicant Requirements and the Common Policy CPS Evaluation Matrix.
- [**Maintain Compliance**]({{site.baseurl}}/who/fpkiaudit/) – Ensure cross-certified entities are compatible with the FBCA CP (or the Federal Common Policy Certification Authority [FCPCA] CP for Federal Legacy CAs).
- **Ensure Agreement with FPKI Management Authority** – Oversee the FPKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) to issue and revoke cross-certificates, ensure adherence to the FPKI CPs, and provide documentation to be archived.
- **Coordinate Interoperability Practices** – Coordinate legal, policy, technical, and business practices and issues related to FPKI Trust Infrastructure.

### Membership and Meetings

Each federal agency’s CIO appoints members and the group operates under the authority of the Federal CIO Council through the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) and the Identity, Credential, and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC). See the [FPKIPA Charter]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpkipa-charter.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for information on membership requirements, voting rights, etc.

FPKIPA members meet in the morning on the second Tuesday of each month. Contact fpki at gsa dot gov to participate in the FPKIPA or its working groups.

## Federal Public Key Infrastructure Management Authority

[The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Management Authority (FPKIMA) enables government-wide trust]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-fpkima-wp.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} by providing trust infrastructure services to federal agencies. The FPKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA) governs FPKIMA and the GSA Federal Acquisition Service manages it.

### Activities
- **Manage Digital Certificate Policies and Standards** Ensure secure physical and logical access, document sharing, and communications across federal agencies and between external business partners.
- **Operate the FPKI Trust Infrastructure**, Operate two main certification authorities (CA):
    - **Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA):** It is the trust anchor for the federal government. Authorized CAs issue certificates for exclusive use by the federal government for federal employees and contractors to include the PKI certificates on the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential.
    - **Federal Bridge CA (FBCA):** It is the PKI Bridge that enables interoperability between and among federally operated and business partner PKIs.
