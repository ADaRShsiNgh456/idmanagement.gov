## NOTICE - Comment on FICAM in FIBF

The ICAMSC through its Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) Working Group seeks comments on the first component of the business framework -
Business Lifecycles. FIBF helps define and agree to common business
requirements, as well as align ICAM with other federal functions such as Human
Resource Management and Cybersecurity. The initial work has been developed by
the working group; we now seek agency-specific knowledge, specifically  insight
into agencies’ ICAM processes on how the common requirements in the Business
Lifecycles are applicable. If not relevant, we ask that you submit suggested
language that would more align to your agency.   

Please download the FICAM-FIBF to review the Business LifeCycles and submit
your feedback in the Cross-Agency Feedback Template. Comment period will end
November 30, 2023.

## M-19-16 - Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for ICAM 

Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government [M-19-16]
calls for the Government to establish a process to identify mission support functions
suitable for sharing based on cross-agency agreement on targeted outcomes and
service delivery standards. These assessments will be performed to determine the
maturity of agencies’ processes with respect to government-wide standards.
However, without agreed upon targeted outcomes and service delivery standards, it
is virtually impossible to evenly gauge the maturity and effectiveness of agency
ICAM implementations to make policy recommendations, as well as identify
opportunities for shared services. There is a need for a business framework that
addresses this challenge. FIBF is an accepted framework to accomplish these
objectives for ICAM

## What is FIBF?

FIBF is generally accepted in the Federal Government as a tool for  documenting
common business requirements; it is currently being used by 13 other Federal
Functional Areas including Financial Management, IT Services, and Cybersecurity. 

To learn more about FIBF, visit the [website](https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} for the Office of Shared Services and
Performance Improvement. 

## ICAM FIBF Team?

The GSA ICAMSC Co-Chair serves as the Business Standards Lead for ICAM
and participates in the Business Standard Council meetings and projects. ICAMSC
members serve as the subject matter experts, bringing not only their
agency-specific knowledge, but also the required domain expertise.  ICAMSC
members are best-positioned  to provide insight into their agency’s ICAM business
requirements. In addition, GSA Office of Technology Policy (OTP) will provide both
ICAM subject matter expertise, as well as coordination support. Working in tandem
as the ICAMSC-chartered FIBF Working Group, the group fosters cross-agency
agreement, as well as alignment with other FIBF functional areas. To join the team,
please send a request to icam@gsa.gov.

## How Agencies can use the FIBF for ICAM

We have submitted business outcomes for ICAM-FIBF to the Business Standards
Council through the GSA, Office of Shared Services and Performance
Improvement for the inclusion of ICAM as a federal function. In parallel, we are
currently developing the business and data standards for ICAM. We have drafted
the Business Lifecycles and are now seeking comments.

Upon approval from the Business Standards Council and the Office of Management
and Budget, the common business requirements for ICAM can be used in the
following ways:

## Translating Policy into Practice

The policies and directives that agencies receive create business needs such as the use of accredited card issuers or establishing an ICAM governance structure. And we, as federal agencies, respond to these business needs with systems, processes, and other business capabilities. However, our responses to these policies are often done in a manner that is uncoordinated. With common ICAM business requirements, it is envisioned that there would be more consistency in how we respond to these business needs.

## Procurement

The ICAM business requirements in FIBF will give agencies a starting point for documenting common requirements in a Performance Work Statement or Statement of Work to gain more consistency in ICAM implementations. Also in procurement, vendors will have insight to the common ICAM business standards as these requirements will be posted on Regulations.gov. Hopefully, this will lead to vendors offering us innovative solutions in sync with the pace of our ICAM implementations.

## Agency Investment Review

Agencies are familiar with their respective investment review process. ICAM-FIBF Business Standards considers policies as well as policy updates—translating them into business standards so that investment decisions made by agencies support agency mission objectives, policy-driven modernization objectives, as well as inter-agency standards and requirements. Further, it is the aim of ICAM-FIBF to ensure that ICAM business standards are incorporated in the Quality Service Management Office (QMSO) marketplace to help agencies gain confidence in solutions. 

## Assess Readiness for Shared Services

Agencies can use business requirements to assess existing shared services, as well as identify opportunities for new intra and inter-agency shared solutions; this includes assessing solutions from the Quality Service Management (QSMO) marketplace. 

## Agreement Across Mission Support Functions

We will work with other FIBF Functional leaders to gain consensus on ICAM business requirements, as well as their linkage to other mission support functions. This will establish a shared understanding of services and coordination needed.
