## NOTICE - Opportunity to Comment on the Draft ICAM-FIBF

The Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) Subcommittee  through its Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) Working Group is establishing ICAM as a federal function that will support and enable practically every mission support area. This will affect not only ICAM programs, but also areas such as Financial Management, Cybersecurity, Electronic Records Management and Human Resource Management, etc.   

The working group is chartered to define the ICAM function using FIBF with workforce identity as the initial scope. The first component of the framework is in draft and the working group seeks agency comments.

Please download the ICAM-FIBF (Workforce Identity Focused)_Website Version (Excel spreadsheet) to review the Business LifeCycles and submit your feedback in the Cross-Agency Feedback Template (Excel spreadsheet). Comment period will end November 30, 2023. 

## ICAM-FIBF Background 

Since the inception of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and OMB M-05-24, it has been a policy goal to establish common ICAM business standards. The FICAM community collectively recognized this goal as a top priority through survey results recently conducted by the ICAM Subcommittee.

As described in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-19-16, the Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) helps agencies identify and gain agreement on common governmentwide capabilities for shared services using the FIBF; thereby making it a natural fit for the ICAMSC to collaborate with OSSPI and leverage the FIBF for the development of common ICAM business standards.

## What is FIBF?

FIBF is generally accepted in the Federal Government as a tool for documenting
common business requirements; it is currently being used by 13 other Federal
Functional Areas including Financial Management, IT Services, and Cybersecurity.  

To learn more about FIBF, visit the [website](https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} for OSSPI. 

## ICAM FIBF Team?

The GSA ICAMSC Co-Chair serves as the Business Standards Lead for ICAM
and participates in the Business Standard Council (BSC) meetings and projects.
ICAMSC members serve as the subject matter experts, bringing not only their
agency-specific knowledge, but also the required domain expertise. ICAMSC
members are best-positioned  to provide insight into their agency’s ICAM business
requirements. In addition, GSA Office of Technology Policy (OTP) will provide both
ICAM subject matter expertise, as well as coordination support. Working in tandem
as the ICAMSC-chartered FIBF Working Group, the group fosters cross-agency
agreement, as well as alignment with other FIBF functional areas. To join the team,
please send a request to icam@gsa.gov.


## How Agencies can use the FIBF for ICAM

Upon approval from the BSC and the Office of Management and Budget, the framework may be used in the following ways:

- **Translating Policy into Practice.** The policies and directives that agencies receive create business needs such as the use of accredited card issuers or establishing an ICAM governance structure. And we, as federal agencies, respond to these business needs with systems, processes, and other business capabilities. However, our responses to these policies are often done in a manner that is uncoordinated. With common ICAM business requirements, it is envisioned that there would be more consistency in how we respond to these business needs.

- **Procurement.** The ICAM business requirements in FIBF will give agencies a starting point for documenting common requirements in a Performance Work Statement or Statement of Work to gain more consistency in ICAM implementations. Also in procurement, vendors will have insight to the common ICAM business standards as these requirements will be posted on Regulations.gov. Hopefully, this will lead to vendors offering us innovative solutions in sync with the pace of our ICAM implementations.

- **Agency Investment Review.**  Agencies are familiar with their respective investment review process. ICAM-FIBF Business Standards considers policies as well as policy updates—translating them into business standards so that investment decisions made by agencies support agency mission objectives, policy-driven modernization objectives, as well as inter-agency standards and requirements. Further, it is the aim of ICAM-FIBF to ensure that ICAM business standards are incorporated in the Quality Service Management Office (QMSO) marketplace to help agencies gain confidence in solutions. 

- **Assess Readiness for Shared Services.** Agencies can use business requirements to assess existing shared services, as well as identify opportunities for new intra and inter-agency shared solutions; this includes assessing solutions from the Quality Service Management (QSMO) marketplace. 

- **Agreement Across Mission Support Functions.** We will work with other FIBF Functional leaders to gain consensus on ICAM business requirements, as well as their linkage to other mission support functions. This will establish a shared understanding of services and coordination needed.
