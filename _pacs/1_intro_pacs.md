This _Physical Access Control System (PACS) Guide_ will help you understand concepts related to _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management_-compliant PACSs.  At a high level, a PACS is a collection of technologies that control physical access at one or more federal agency sites by electronically authenticating employees, contractors, and visitors. 

{% include alert-info.html content="The contents of this guide are meant to be informative and do not serve as the basis for determining PACS compliance. Agency-specific guidance should supersede the recommendations within this guide, where appropriate." %}
