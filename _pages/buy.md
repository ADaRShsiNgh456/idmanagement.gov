Find approved products and services for Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) implementations, and helpful links for purchasing these items using GSA Schedules.

## Products

The FICAM testing program – also known as the Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program – tests commercial products used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKI). These products have been tested and approved to ensure you’re buying products that provide value, and work well together.

The Approved Products List (APL) contains the official list of these tested products.

- Visit the Approved Products List page.

Products and services that have lost their certification are placed on the Removed Products List (RPL). You can view both “approved” and “removed” products via the APL. Contact us if you’re unsure if a product is fit for government use.
