The Federal Acquisition Service leads the FPKI Management Authority (FPKIMA), which is responsible for operating the Federal Bridge and Federal Root Certificate Authorities.
The Office of Government-wide Policy co-chairs the FPKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA) and manages the governance and oversight of the certificate policies, federal shared service providers, and compliance audit reviews.
The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible for security authorizations and continuous monitoring for commercially-operated PKI shared service providers.
