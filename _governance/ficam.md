The ICAMSC is the principal interagency forum for identity management, secure access, authentication, authorization, credentials, privileges, and access lifecycle management. It’s a sub-committee of the [Federal CIO Council’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council](https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/ciso-council/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

The ICAMSC is co-chaired by the [GSA Office of Government-wide Policy](https://gsa.gov/portal/category/21399){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The ICAMSC aligns the identity management activities of the Federal Government, and supports collaborative government-wide efforts to:

# Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority

The FPKIPA serves the interest of U.S. Federal Government organizations as relying parties and promotes interoperability between federal and non-federal entities by:
- Setting policy governing the FPKI Trust Infrastructure;
- Approving applicants for cross certification with the FBCA; and
- Providing oversight to the Certified PKI Shared Service Provider (SSP) Program.

It is co-chaired by the GSA Office of Government-wide Policy. The GSA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible for security authorizations and continuous monitoring for commercially-operated PKI shared service providers.

## Activities
- **Approve Policies and Practices** – Approve Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) and Federal Common Policy Certification Authority Certificate Policies (CPs), including revisions; approve FPKI Trust Infrastructure Certification Practice Statements.
- **Approve Entity Cross-Certification** – Establish and administer criteria and methodology for cross-certification with the FBCA; approve cross-certifications and execute Memoranda of - Agreement (MOAs); maintain the FPKI Certification Applicant Requirements and the Common Policy CPS Evaluation Matrix.
- **Maintain Compliance** – Ensure cross-certified entities are compatible with the FBCA CP (or the FCPCA CP for Federal Legacy CAs).
- **Agreement with FPKI Management Authority** – Oversee the FPKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) to issue and revoke cross-certificates, ensure adherence to the FPKI CPs, and provide documentation to be archived.
- **Interoperability Practices** – Coordinate legal, policy, technical, and business practices and issues related to FPKI Trust Infrastructure.

## Membership and Meetings

Members are appointed by each federal agency’s CIO, and the group operates under the authority of the Federal CIO Council through the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) and the Identity, Credential, and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC). See the [FPKIPA Charter](../../docs/fpkipa-charter.pdf){:target="_blank"} (PDF, February 2015) for information on membership requirements, voting rights, etc.

The FPKIPA meets in the morning on the second Tuesday of each month. Contact fpki at gsa.gov to participate in the FPKIPA or its working groups.

# Federal Public Key Infrastructure Management Authority

[The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Management Authority (FPKIMA) enables government-wide trust](../../docs/fpki-fpkima-wp.pdf){:target="_blank"} by providing trust infrastructure services to federal agencies. FPKIMA is governed under the Federal PKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA) and managed by the GSA Federal Acquisition Service.

## Activities
- **Manage digital certificate policies and standards** to ensure secure physical and logical access, document sharing, and communications across federal agencies and between external business partners.
- **Operate the Federal PKI Trust Infrastructure**, which consists of two main certification authorities (CA):
    - **Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA)** is the trust anchor for the Federal Government. Authorized CAs issue certificates for exclusive use by the Federal Government for federal employees and contractors, to include the PKI certificates on the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential.
    - **Federal Bridge CA (FBCA)** is the PKI Bridge that enables interoperability between and among federally operated and business partner PKIs.
