he Federal ICAM (FICAM) program helps federal agencies plan and manage enterprise identity, credentialing and access management (ICAM) through collaboration opportunities and guidance on IT policy, standards, implementation and architecture. Most of the guidance and best practices found on this website are developed through interagency working groups.

# FICAM Playbooks

The FICAM Roadmap, developed by the federal CIO Council, contains processes, procedures, and considerations for planning and managing logical access, physical access, identity management, and federation within federal agencies. But the Roadmap was last updated in 2011, and as technology, policy and security practices rapidly evolve, the government must also evolve. To modernize the original FICAM Roadmap, we’ve begun migrating this information to playbooks. 

These playbooks are hosted on Github, and provide common policy and patterns to help you implement and execute ICAM at your agency. The playbooks are a government-wide collaboration based on needs and interest of individual agencies and government-wide groups. Reach out to icam at gsa.gov to suggest new topics.
