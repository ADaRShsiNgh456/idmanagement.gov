  This file is used to provide a way to link directly to an external URL from a dropdown menu item.

  Issue this solves: 
  - Direct external links in dropdown menus do not work in federalist preview
  - Putting single quotes around the external link works on local builds but not in federalist preview
  - Allows a work around for difficult linkage due to how Jekyll builds its URL graph

  Usage: 
  - Create an .md file along side the content related to the redirect
  - Add 'title' and 'permalink' to the files Front Matter
  - Include 'redirect.html' file from '_includes/' directory with a 'redirect_to=' property set to the URL you are redirecting to. 
  - Additionally, add an HTML or Liquid comment for more info at a later time
  - Default delay on redirect is 0 seconds

    Front Matter:
    - title: title for the page
    - permalink: url to the page, site or resource
    - description: descriptive note of reason for redirect
    - comments: notes for later reference about this redirect, exp: purpose, approval, requirement

    Redirect body: 
    - Set the 'redirect_to=' to the url, site, or resource  
    - In your include for redirect.html, set redirect_to="[website url, document or url]"

    Note: If quoted url strings work in dropdown items on the productions site like it 
           works on a locally run site, then use quoted url strings over using this redirect.
