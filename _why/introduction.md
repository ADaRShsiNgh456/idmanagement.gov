The __Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)__ architecture site describe the basics of ICAM, the FICAM architecture, and how you can use this information to facilitate enterprise ICAM practices at your agency.

FICAM is the federal government’s implementation of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM). *__ICAM__* is the set of tools, policies, and systems that an agency uses to enable the *__right individual__* to access the *__right resource__*, at the *__right time__*, for the *__right reason__* in support of *__federal business objectives__*.

The FICAM architecture encompasses the __enterprise__ ICAM policies, technologies, and system approaches for government employees, contractors, and authorized partners. Citizen interactions with the federal government - or consumer ICAM - are not covered under the FICAM architecture.

The FICAM architecture includes government-wide enterprise architecture views with the flexibility to support each agency’s unique business or mission needs. Use the FICAM architecture as a tool to continuously improve your agency’s approach and better align with federal security and privacy initiatives.
