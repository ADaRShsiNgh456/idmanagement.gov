FICAM is the foundation for U.S Government agencies to mature towards Zero Trust cyber security architecture. Implementing identity credentials and access management concepts, policies, procedures and playbooks provides agencies a Zero Trust implementation strategy framework and directly supports the FICAM initiatives in OMB M-22-09 Federal Zero Trust Strategy and CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model version 2.0. 

## Definition
Zero Trust concepts assume there are no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established.

## FICAM areas aligned to M-22-09
**Privileged user** is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users cannot perform—also known as a privileged IT user, privileged network user, or superuser. FICAM [Privileged Identity Playbook]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/pam/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a great place to start with ensuring robust management of privileged users and identities.

**Phishing resistant authenticator** is usually immune to social engineering type of attacks and provides a greater level of security and resilience than traditional authenticators. The FICAM team has created a [Phishing Resistant Authenticator Criteria]({{site.baseurl}}/vendor/ficampc/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to help agencies accelerate adoption of phishing resistant authenticators. This criteria is a starting point for agencies to get started in their journey towards phishing resistant authenticators as they enhance their identity management systems. In addition, phishing resistant playbook helps agencies get a head start in implementing the concepts, saving agencies time and money.

**Single Sign On** centralizes application access for agency employees and contractors, or federate access with other federal executive agencies. Leveraging the [Enterprise Single Sign On Playbook]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/sso/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} will help agencies with enhanced management control of identities in a consolidated manner. Agencies are encouraged to use this playbook to centralize application access for agency employees and contractors, or federate access with other federal executive agencies.

**User authorization** is a decision whether to grant access to a user or machine account following authentication. Authorization to resources can be fine grained to help achieve attribute based access vs the traditional role based access. FICAM has resources to help agencies with user authorization management activities as part of their ICAM solutions. Agencies can get started by leveraging [Cloud Identity Playbook]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/cloud/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} as a starting point. This playbook provides practical guidance to assist federal agencies  startor further expand their use of workforce identity credential, and access management services in a cloud operating model.

**Identity lifecycle management** encompasses the activities of creating, identity proofing, vetting, provisioning, aggregating, maintaining, and deactivating digital identities on an agency’s enterprise ICAM systems. The FICAM team provides a detailed [Identity Lifecycle Management Playbook]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/ilm/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to help shift the focus from managing the access based on credentials to managing the entire lifecycle of identities.

## FICAM alignment to CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model
The [CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} is a good place to start while agencies plan their Zero Trust implementation journey. This model has five pillars that complement each other as part of the overall objective to achieve continued modernization efforts related to Zero Trust within a rapidly evolving technology landscape. One of the main pillars of this model is Identity that is in line with the FICAM framework. Even though this maturity model is one of the many paths to zero trust, it leads agencies to success by providing guidance. Use [IDManagement]({{site.baseurl}}) resources to achieve Identity pillar objectives defined within this maturity model efficiently.
